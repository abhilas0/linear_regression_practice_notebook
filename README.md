# linear regression practice notebook
Practice notebook for linear regression

## Description
This notebook divided into two parts 

* [Part-1](https://github.com/abhilas0/linear_regression_practice_notebook/tree/master/Using_simple_dataset) - implementation using simple dummy dataset
* [Part-2](https://github.com/abhilas0/linear_regression_practice_notebook/tree/master/using_real_dataset) - implementation using real life dataset (boston house data)

In part-2, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.


## Dataset Used
The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts.
